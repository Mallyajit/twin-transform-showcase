## 🌐 Project Overview

A **Digital Twin** is a virtual representation of a real-world object, system, or process that evolves with its physical counterpart. This website highlights how digital twins are shaping industries and helping us predict, simulate, and improve real-world outcomes.

The website contains:

- **Homepage**  
  - A central landing page with interactive visuals and tagline:  
    *“Where the physical meets the virtual.”*  
  - Buttons linking to different industry applications.

- **Subpages**  
  1. **Engineering & Manufacturing** – Digital twins optimize production, reduce downtime, and drive innovation.  
  2. **Smart Transport** – Real-time monitoring and predictive insights make travel seamless and efficient.  
  3. **Healthcare** – Virtual patient models enable safer, faster, and more personalized treatments.  

Each section uses **modern UI animations, hover transitions, and thematic color palettes** to visually connect traditional practices with futuristic digital innovation.
